## 2 ##	Plotting conservation between protein sequences
#######

#determine and plot conservation levels between sequenecs across taxonoic groups
#establish similarity within user sequence set chosen
#output to screen and save as file output
#limit number of sequences to no more than 250 most similar



# we can use emboss plotcon for it
# or clustalo too
# or blast

# we need to make a protein database with our previous data
